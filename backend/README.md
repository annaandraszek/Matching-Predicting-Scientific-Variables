# Matching scientific variables using machine learning

"Creating machine-readable data services is an important part of making data accessible, but if the terms used to describe the variables in the data are not formalised, the data can still be very hard to understand and use without sometimes significant human intervention."

This project contains a Python RESTful webservice that takes free text terms and returns suggested vocabulary terms. The vocabulary terms include scienctific observable properties and units, most of which can be found at http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/environment/_property and http://registry.it.csiro.au/def/qudt/1.1/_qudt-unit.

To run the web application, navigate to app.py and run it. 

More information on use and results can be found in user_guide.ipynb and results.ipynb respectively.
