    "## 3. Suggestions for future improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating qualifier words\n",
    "- By adding a method that identifies 'qualifier' words (eg. maximum, minimum, total, average, mean) which may appear in any property term but only affect its limit and not its intrinsic meaning, and deals with them seperately. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since these words are limited, they could be easily be all stored in a dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I don't think it would be a good idea to create seperate versions of property classes which only differed in containing a qualifier word (eg. \"average wind speed\" vs the current \"wind speed\"), as even though that could be more informative, it would be difficult to implement. Classes which could exist with these qualifier words would have to be identified, the number of permutations and therefore new classes would be high, and at least one sample of training data would have to be created for each new class. However, if it was genuinely more informative to do this, and only for a number of classes that would benefit from it, it absolutely could.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Problem: qualifier words are sometimes already part of a property name. In these cases, they do not just limit the property, but are an intrinsic part of it. For example, \"MSLP\", or, \"mean sea level pressure\"; \"total solids\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggestion: remove qualifier words from the input string once identified, and append onto the output string when returning results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension of training data\n",
    "- The classifier probabilities are currently very sensitive as each class has a very small number of samples. More sample data for each class would increase confidence and accuracy.\n",
    "- If more class labels and data were found, they could be added to the training sets to give the classifier a broader scope in what labels it could assign.\n",
    "- Suggestion: to increase accuracy, add more data samples. To extend scope, add more classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve input segmentation\n",
    "- Currently, input words are classified as \"property\" or \"unit\", then sent to those respective classifiers to be classified more specifically. The machine learning model which performs the binary classification is a recurrent neural network with an LSTM (long short term memory) layer, which allows it to retain the knowledge of the order in which it receives words. However, this is currently not relevant as it only receives one word at a time (windowsize = 1). If the windowsize were changed to 2, it could more correctly classify words which are usually \"unit\" (or \"property\"), but in that context belong to \"property\". For example, \"chrorophyll a concentration\" is all one property, but when segmented one-by-one, \"a\" would be categorised as a unit.\n",
    "- This has not been implemented as the current method for segmentation is fairly simple, and sends the words in the property and unit sets to their respective classifiers. However, with two words receiving the same class at a time, words which were at a boundary of property and unit phrases could be sent to the wrong classifier. For example, given, \"water temp degree celsius\", with a windowsize=2, the inputs to the segmenter would be: [\"water temp\", \"temp degree\", \"degree celcius\"]. And the inputs to the classifiers would be something like: property['water', 'temp', 'degree']; unit['temp', 'degree', 'celsius'] - overlapping. This could just be noisy, or could contribute to misclassification.\n",
    "- Suggestion: modify the segment_user_string method in main.py to use a more complex algorithm and a window_size higher than 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrate user-created data into models\n",
    "- On the web application, there is currently a form into which a user can enter input strings and select their matching classes, to have that data added to a file which can be included in the training set. However, integration for this is not yet supported as it is very easy to create bad data, and it would all need to be validated first.\n",
    "- Suggestion: if the web application is hosted and becomes used, the user_trainingset.csv file can be added to the files which go through the raw_to_clean function in preprocessing.py to become part of the training set."
